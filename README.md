# HeroHistory

HeroHistory is a data visualization site meant to distill the information about all of your favorite comic book publishers and superhero movies into beautiful, readable graphs and tables. Want to know the origin of a hero or what source material you can read to learn more about the character? Maybe you'd prefer to watch the movies starring this character and learn some information about it? We've got you covered. Using Marvel and ComicVine external APIs with D3 library implementation for visualization, HeroHistory gives you a user-friendly interface to learn more about and interact with your favorite heroes!
